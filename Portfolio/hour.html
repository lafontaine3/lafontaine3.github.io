		<h1>Genius Hour</h1>
		<div class="content">
		<h2>What is my driving question?</h2>
		How can I create a drone delivery service, what can I do with it, and how does a drone work?
		<h2>What is Genius Hour?</h2>
		Genius hour is a project we do where we pick a subject and write about it.
		<h2>Why did I choose my topic?</h2>
		I did not come up with my topic. I really struggled and had to ask for suggestions. I had to collaborate and come up with a topic.
		<h2>How Do Drones Work?</h2>
<p><image class="fl" src="images/flight.jpg" alt=" The 4 forces of flight" width=400 height=240/>The way a quadcopter works, is the engine makes motors turn, which cause propellers to turn, which makes the drone fly. The drone turns by having some propellers slow down, and that causes it to turn. There are many parts that make the drones work. These are in the table below. Another important thing about speed, is how airspeed works. I first must explain groundspeed. Your groundspeed is the speed you go on the ground. Like if you are walking 7 miles per hour, you are going 7 miles per hour no matter what kind of wind. Airspeed is groundspeed + thrust or – tailwind (<em>a</em>=<em>g</em>+<em>w</em>). Therefore, if you were a bird and you were flying 7 miles per hour, and there was a 3 MPH tailwind, you will be going 4 miles per hour. You also need to factor in the four forces of flight. Thrust, lift, drag, and weight. If you use a quadcopter, you can let your aircraft float in the air. That was how a drone works in a nutshell. </p>

<h2>What are the parts of a drone?</h2>

<tr><td>The Frame</td><td>Holds everything together</td></tr>
<tr><td>The motors</td><td>Turn the propellers</td></tr>
<tr><td>The Battery</td><td>Gives the moters power</td></tr>
<tr><td>The Propellers</td><td>Gives the drone lift</td></tr>
<tr><td>The ESC (Electronic Speed Controller)</td><td>Sets the speed of the motor</td></tr>
<tr><td>The Transmitter</td><td>Controls what direction it goes</td></tr>
</table>
</div>
<h2>How can I apply this to the real world?</h2>
<image class="fl" src="images/dronebox.jpg" alt=" A drone with a box" width=200 height=120/>I can apply this, by delivering stuff to people with drones. That is all I have to do. I can create a website with some products, get some drones, and start delivering. I also could also outsource my business and have other company’s benefit from my service. I can have them pay me to let them use my drones for things like pizza and medicine. There will be competition though. Companies like Amazon are trying to do this. I think that people will want to use this. In fact, 33 out of the 46 people polled would be willing to use drone delivery. So people will use it. It also would be cool to get something delivered to you by a drone, so the novelty of in itself would be enough to draw people in.</br>
