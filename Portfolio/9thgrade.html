Hello, 你好，and welcome to my 9th grade portfolio. I have grown, struggled, and excelled in a lot of projects and classes this year. In August, I was not very different. I knew less, but really I am the same person. Or was I? You could say I’m different. Was I a different person? He knew no Chinese words and did not know how to find the hypotenuse of a triangle, but I do. Am I the same person? I have all of his memories, but he does not know the 9th grade curriculum. At what point, am I different? In August I was less mature and knew less, but does that make me different?  But, I digress, I will be prepared for 10th grade next year, because I know how to use illustrator to my advantage, have learned the basic Chinese, and know the form of a basic MLA essay.</br>
I excelled in Adobe Illustrator and the graph art project. In this project, we used a software called Adobe Illustrator to remake an art piece. I chose my portrait in 1960 by James Ensor. One of the reasons I did well is because of the line analysis I made in math class. I used this to figure out exactly where to put the figure. I got the idea for how I remade it, because I had a dead guy in a coffin so, I chose to do a living guy on a couch. I believe it turned out pretty nice. Adobe Illustrator came sort of easy to me so that also worked in my favor. I also recognized what patterns should go where and what small details I should add. </br>
I struggled in the mock trial project. I have never been much of a writer, so when I heard about this project, I got worried. I did not think it would be a most pleasant experience. As it turns out, I was right. In the provided case, I had to defend the person who killed another women in a car crash. I did not get very far before realizing that there is almost no argument for the defense. We had a packet that we had to write the evidence in. I got half way through the defense column and could not find any more evidence.  I overcame this struggle by spending some time, looking over the little evidence provided for the case, and with my persistence, finally had a decent presentation. I did ended up getting an A-, so I guess my hard work paid off.</br>
Finally, I grew in Chinese class. At first I was not the best Chinese linguist. You can see this by looking at my Chinese video. I had to put the sounds I had to make on a paper in order to perform the video. The words that I used were easy, too. I use those on a daily basis but now I have really improved. Using Quizlet, I was able to study more, and you can see that I have improved with my recent test scores. I have gotten at least an 85% most of the recent tests I have taken.  </br>
Now, come May, I will keep growing, excelling, and struggling less in my writing. I believe I will go to 10th grade prepared, because of all the skills that I gained in 9th. I will also try to do better with time management, because currently mine is not working out.  This year, I used the quality of persistence the most. I used this one because I had to persist through all of the projects happening at once. I had a lot of home work on many nights, along with my busy schedule, which required lots of persistence.
